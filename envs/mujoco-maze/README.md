Some maze environments for reinforcement learning (RL) based on [mujoco-py]
and [openai gym][gym].

Thankfully, this project is based on the code from  [rllab] and
[tensorflow/models][models].

Note that [d4rl] and [dm_control] have similar maze
environments, and you can also check them.
But, if you want more customizable or minimal one, I recommend this.

## Usage

Importing `mujoco_maze` registers environments and you can load
environments by `gym.make`.
All available environments listed are listed in [Environments] section.

E.g.,:
```python
import gym
import mujoco_maze  # noqa
env = gym.make("Ant4Rooms-v0")
```

## Customize Environments
You can define your own task by using components in `maze_task.py`,
like:

```python
import gym
import numpy as np
from mujoco_maze.maze_env_utils import MazeCell
from mujoco_maze.maze_task import MazeGoal, MazeTask
from mujoco_maze.point import PointEnv


class GoalRewardEMaze(MazeTask):
    REWARD_THRESHOLD: float = 0.9
    PENALTY: float = -0.0001

    def __init__(self, scale):
        super().__init__(scale)
        self.goals = [MazeGoal(np.array([0.0, 4.0]) * scale)]

    def reward(self, obs):
        return 1.0 if self.termination(obs) else self.PENALTY

    @staticmethod
    def create_maze():
        E, B, R = MazeCell.EMPTY, MazeCell.BLOCK, MazeCell.ROBOT
        return [
            [B, B, B, B, B],
            [B, R, E, E, B],
            [B, B, B, E, B],
            [B, E, E, E, B],
            [B, B, B, E, B],
            [B, E, E, E, B],
            [B, B, B, B, B],
        ]


gym.envs.register(
    id="PointEMaze-v0",
    entry_point="mujoco_maze.maze_env:MazeEnv",
    kwargs=dict(
        model_cls=PointEnv,
        maze_task=GoalRewardEMaze,
        maze_size_scaling=GoalRewardEMaze.MAZE_SIZE_SCALING.point,
        inner_reward_scaling=GoalRewardEMaze.INNER_REWARD_SCALING,
    )
)
```
You can also customize models. See `point.py` or so.

## Warning
Reacher enviroments are not tested.

## [Experimental] Web-based visualizer
By passing a port like `gym.make("PointEMaze-v0", websock_port=7777)`,
one can use a web-based visualizer when calling `env.render()`.

This feature is experimental and can produce some zombie proceses.
